My email client & server for umail.com case study.
This project allows users of the umail database to send emails to other members of the database.

Author: Aliyyah Uddin

How to build and run the program:
Open intelliJ IDE, go to open project, browse your computer and select this project to open it.
There are two classes: EmailServer and EmailClient.
First run the EmailServer class.
Then run the EmailClient class at the same time.
Once both classes are running, drag and drop the EmailClient terminal so that both terminals are side by side.
This way you can see the EmailClient messages at the same time as the EmailServer.
Now you have built and run the program.
You can now go ahead and answer the questions which appear on the EmailClient terminal to send an email.

Note: you must enter an email that is in the "m" hashmap (this is a database of 5 emails) otherwise your email will not be accepted.
